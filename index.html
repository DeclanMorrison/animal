    <h1>Hello, my name is Declan and my favorite animal the The Animal</h1>

    <p>The Animal is the best muppet because of reasons. I don't need to explain myself to you.</p>

    <p>But also there was that whole "Muh-Nuh-Muh-Nuh" thing that made a big splash in the internet, so that's pretty good.</p>
